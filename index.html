  <p><strong>Why are Spain so good at football? Why can English players never pass the ball around like Barcelona? Football matches regularly get called off because of rain, why can't we play inside?</strong></p>
  <p> The answer to all those questions is <strong>Futsal</strong>.</p>
  <p>Similar to five-a-side football, futsal is played indoors on a hard court surface and is restricted by lines. The name originates from the Spanish fútbol sala or fútbol de salón meaning 'room football'. </p>

  <p>It consists of two teams of five, including a goalkeeper and the game is played with a smaller, but heavier ball.</p>

  <p>The ball, surface, rules and size of the pitch means there is an emphasis on skill, creativity and technique.</p>

  <p> For years, efforts have been made to try and make futsal an Olympic sport as the Games are seen as the stage that helps sports develop through publicity and funding. <p>

  <p> This summer two new sports will be played in Rio - Golf and Rugby sevens, so will futsal become an Olympic Sport in the future?<p>

<p> Therefore, it can be argued that futsal has the history and tradition to become an Olympic sport.<p>

<p>Back in November 2012 before Brazil beat Spain 3-2 in the FIFA Futsal World Cup Final, the then FIFA President Sepp Blatter told the <i>Oceania Football Confederation</i> that he promised to get futsal into the Olympic Games.<p>
  <blockquote class="center">
    <strong>"Futsal is a growing game being played all over the world.</strong>
  </blockquote>
<p>"Because there isn't much space available in some countries to play outdoor football, there is a need to play indoors.<p>
<p>"We should start developing futsal at national and confederation level - this would be a step in the development of futsal.<p>
<p>"For the time being, we are on the waiting list."<p>
<p> Of course, a lot has changed at FIFA since those words were uttered by Sepp Blatter, but the fact remains more and more people are playing futsal and the likelihood of it becoming an Olympic Sport in future games is a reality.<p>

<p> Futsal shoes are lightweight, a similar style to football boots and astroturfs, but the sole is flat, made out of gum rubber, as this is the part of the foot that is most used.</p>

<div class="infos info2" id="info2">
<p> The ball should be controlled initially by the sole of the foot to stop it to play the next pass or shoot.</p>
</div>
<div class="infos info3" id="info3">
<p> The weight of the shoes allows for fast-play and the rubber soles create traction on the indoor court surface.</p>

<p>The ball is smaller than a football, at size 4 and is heavier meaning there is less bounce.</p>
</div>
<div class="infos info5" id="info5">
<p> The ball must weigh between 400-440 grams and after being dropped from a height of 2 metres it should bounce back between 50 and 65 centimetres. This encourages players to keep the ball on the floor.</p>

<p>Futsal has become more and more popular in the UK over recent years, so much so that there are now 38 Futsal Clubs across the country.<p>
<p>The England national team was set up in 2003, making it one of the last countries in Europe to have a national side. While, the FA Futsal League was only set up back in 2008.<p>
<p>A team that is developing all the time is Sheffield FC which has a number of players from Spain, including their player/manager, Ernest Cardona, who has played futsal from an early age.<p>

  <p>Although a football match is more than double the length of a futsal game, the intensity of a futsal match combined with the amount of time the ball is out of play in a 11-a-side game means the heart rate is at a constant high level when playing futsal.<p>

<p>There are currently 310 events at the Summer Olympics with 10,500 athletes competing.</p>
<p>This is the limit and therefore in order for futsal to become an Olympic sport it has to prove it offers more than the sports already in the Games and those which are also bidding to be part of one of the largest sporting events in the world.</p>

<p>One way in which futsal could improve its case is for FIFA to hold a Women's World Cup. A Women's World Tournament currently exists, but this is not organised by the official body of FIFA.</p>

    <h2>Lilith Brown, 21, who plays futsal in Sweden, said:</h2>
    <h3>"There's no simple way of playing the game. </h3>
    <h3> "You can't avoid the ball, you can't have a rest. </h3>
    <h3>"As soon as you don't have the ball it's your job to create the spaces on a small pitch."</h3>

<p>The sport was refused entry into the 2008 Beijing Olympics back in 2002 on the grounds that the Olympic Programme Commission believed there was 'low global participation' in futsal and the fact that it is too similar to football.</p>

<p>Changes have occurred over the 14 years since the bid was rejected in that participation in futsal has grown so much over that time and is continuing to rise.</p>

<p>The problem is that futsal, although one can see it is different to football, is considered too similar to football by those making the decision and therefore if futsal has to replace 11-a-side football, it may take an awfully long time.</p>

<p> Also, for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which helps with the decision on what sports become Olympic sports, they base a lot of the decision on how much money the sport can make in terms of sponsorship and deals with broadcasters.</p>
<p>At the London 2012 Olympic Games, <strong>1.9 million football tickets</strong> were sold and the IOC are unlikely to want to lose this sort of revenue.</p>

<p> However, beach and indoor volleyball are essentially the same, and yet both are disciplines in the Olympic Games.</p>

<p> Although football is a hugely popular sport, there is a chance that futsal could replace 11-a-side football as the men's game in the Olympics is limited to under 23s with three overage players allowed meaning not all the big stars are on display.</p>
<p>The biggest football sporting event is the FIFA World Cup for football fans, players and FIFA and therefore futsal could replace 'the beautiful game' in the Summer Games.</p>

<p> The amount of stadiums needed for both men's and women's 11-a-side football to go ahead in the Olympic Games is a lot, while futsal can be played in an arena where handball or another indoor sport is played which is cost-effective for the city hosting the Games.</p>
